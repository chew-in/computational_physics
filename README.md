# Computational Physics
This project includes my solution and write-up for a Computational Physics class I was teaching, where we solve interesting problems in physics, in FORTRAN 77 and Python. 

## Table of Content
* Random Number Generator (RNG) - introduce and perform statistical analysis on various common techniques for RNG
* Cellular Automaton & Emergence - build Conwayâ€™s game of life and simulate collective behavior
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - understand how deep learning works under the hood
* Monte Carlo method
* Numerical Simulation - optimize rod distance in Chicago-Pile 1
* Finite Element Analysis (FEA) - apply FEA technique in a heat diffusion example
