# Computational Physics
This project includes my solution and write-up for a Computational Physics class I was teaching, where we solve interesting physics problems, in FORTRAN 77 and Python. 

## Table of Contents
- `1_random_number_generator`. Random Number Generator: motivation, mechanism, pitfall, statistical analysis.
- `2_emergence`. Emergence: cellular automaton - how complexity arises from simple rules, Conwayâ€™s Game of Life.
- `3_artificial_neural_network`. Artificial Neural Network: building from scratch in Python without any deep learning libraries - 1) a single layer perceptron for equivalence logic, 2) a double layer perceptron for XOR logic, 3) a full neural network for categorizing MNIST dataset. Transfer function comparison, learning rate optimization, statistical analysis on training error and test error, modifying the partition of training and test dataset.
- `4_Monte_Carlo`. Monte Carlo: using Monte Carlo technique to estimate the value of $\pi$ by throwing and counting darts in the first quadrant, statistical and error analysis.
- `5_Chicago-Pile1`. Numerical Simulation,- optimize rod distance in Chicago-Pile1
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA), see folder `FEA` - apply FEA technique in a heat diffusion example
